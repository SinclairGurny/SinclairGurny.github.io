    I worked with students during lab times and during office hours. During labs students are tasked with completing an assignment split into several checkpoints. During office hours students come to TAs for help with homework, labs, or other class related questions. Overall, I helped students in learning the material, debugging code, and answering conceptual and syntax related questions.
