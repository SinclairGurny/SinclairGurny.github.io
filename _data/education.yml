    I learned a lot from my time at RPI. I have taken courses in everything from Circuits to Neuroscience. My focus was distributed systems, distributed programming languages, and high-performance computing within my computer science courses. Within cognitive science my focus was artificial intelligence, with my biggest interest being cognitive architectures.

    My graduate research in the Worldwide Computing Lab was focused on distributed. My thesis "Learning Models from Avionics Data Streams" focused on the applications of declarative machine-learning to estimate fixed-wing aircraft weight during take-off.
