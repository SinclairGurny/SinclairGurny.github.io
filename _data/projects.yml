  name: Compiler for PSIL (a Homemade Scheme Variant) [2019]
  github: SinclairGurny/PSIL
  description: >
      Interpretter for a simple LISP language written in <mark>C++</mark> built from the ground up. 
      The language is based on lambda calculus. 
      I started this project as a way of refreshing my knowledge of modern <mark>C++</mark> and learning more about compilers. 
      As a fairly simple programming language PSIL is not the most useful or unique of languages but it was a fun project and I learned a lot.

  github: SinclairGurny/Robot_Controller
  description: >
    I got a kit for this WiFi controlled tank robot with a pan and tilt camera and it came with a nearly unusable controller program.
    So I wrote a graphical controller in <mark>Python</mark> <mark>PyQt5</mark> and <mark>OpenCV</mark> features for facial recognition and Aruco tag tracking.

  github: SinclairGurny/LSPT_Crawling1
  description: >
    In my course Large Scale Programming and Testing the class was tasked with creating a search engine.
    There were groups for crawling, link analysis, indexing, document data storage, and user interface.
    We created our <mark>RESTful API</mark> for our web crawling server. 
    Written in <mark>Python</mark> using <mark>BeautifulSoup</mark> for web crawling and <mark>Flask</mark> for the HTTP server.

  description: >
    A computer mouse that I designed, built, and programmed using an <mark>Arduino</mark> and various sensors. 
    The mouse has multiple programmed modes and includes gesture controls via an accelerometer and haptic feedback via a vibration motor. 
    This is my most polished and usable electronics project.

  description: >
    A <mark>Raspberry Pi</mark> and <mark>Arduino</mark> based robot which uses sensors to detect obstacles and navigate around them. 
    It uses ultrasonic and infrared distance sensors and uses Robot Operating System (<mark>ROS</mark>) to control the robot. 
    This was my final project for Algorithmic Robotics.

  name: Checkers Game and AI [2014]
  github: SinclairGurny/Random_Old_Programs
  description: >
    One of my first programming projects and one of my favorites. 
    I created a Checkers game with a working graphical interface and AI opponent in <mark>Racket</mark> (a variant of <mark>Scheme</mark>). 
    This project was my first dive into functional programming and artificial intelligence programming. 
    What I learned in this project helped me greatly during my time at RPI.
